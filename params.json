This was back when I was still participating on and consuming Twitter with any kind of regularity. I was scrolling through my feed when someone I follow tweeted \"Looks like LCD Soundsystem has something special going on right now at Madison Square Garden\".  And that was enough for me to investigate.  I had heard of LCD Soundsystem, but I handn't HEARD them. Not in that you can hear Jimi but you can't really hear Jimi kind of way that Woody and Wesley debated in White Men Can't Jump, but in that literal way. I truly hadn't heard a note of LCD Soundsystem previously. At least not in that fully aware, \"hey, this is a cool LCD song\" kind of way.\r\n",
